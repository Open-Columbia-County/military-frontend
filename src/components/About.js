            <p>Hi!  I am a US Navy Veteran myself.  A few years before publishing this website I got remairried and my Husband knew that as a Veteran I am entitled to certain benefits but having not been a Navy Spouse he didn't know how to even go about accessing these benefits if I couldn't</p>
            <p>Knowing how difficult it can be to get to my disability information I knew that trying to explain things and make sure that he knew what he needed wasn't going to be an easy task.</p>
            <p>So using my skills as a Web Developer I figured I could create a place that would not only help him but the many other Veteran families out there that just might not know. </p>
